## Project Description

You sit down with a respresentative of an online retailing business that are looking to build a new e-commerce platform for their business. In the interview, he gives the following description of what they want in the new platform:

'''
We require an e-commerce platform to display our products and allow users to search and purchase items. Since we are an online retailer, our products will have different categories. The product will have a description, a serial number, price, and quantity in store. It would also be preferrable to have an image displayed of the product and have simple inventory management as part of the system.

The platform should keep track of our customer information. At the minimum, we expect to keep records of our customers' names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers. The platform should also provide some CRM features to help us manage our customers to improve their loyalty. For that, we need to at least keep track of the purchase history of our customers and calculate a profitability score for them.

We are also interested in ways in which to promote sales of our products. Customers should be able to review and read reviews on our products or see which of our products are selling the most from different categories.
'''

The description would be a good start for your team to set the main requirements. It represents the bare minimum that should be included in the system. You can go beyond what the description provides for additional credits, but be sure to cover the customer requirements.

USe this description to build the ER Diagram for your project then start putting together requirements in the form of tickets. Then start implementing the system and updating the tickets as you get more ideas on how to improve the system. Do your best to implement as much of the requirements as you can. Be sure to leave the tickets that you do not complete in the ticket management system as it will indicate how much you have thought about the system.
